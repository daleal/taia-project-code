In other words, we still don't know what b is.\n\nBut we do know that \n\no = 68\n\nand that \n\no + b = 12.\n\nWe also know that \n\no > b.\n\nThat's because more children got off the bus than those that got on. So we have 2 equations and 2 variables, which means we can solve this! All we have to do is solve 1 equation for 1 variable, and then plug that answer into the other equation. Let's use substitution, and solve for b first. \n\nWe know that \n\no + b = 12,\n\nand that \n\no = 68.\n\nSo \n\n68 + b = 12\n\n68 + b - 68 = 12 - 68\n\nb = -56\n\nThat can't be right, because we know that \n\nb > 0.\n\nThat means that we made a mistake somewhere, probably when we solved for b. Let's look back at our work. \n\nWe know that \n\no + b = 12,\n\nand that \n\no = 68.\n\nSo \n\n68 + b = 12\n\n68 + b - 68 = 12 - 68\n\nb = -56\n\nWe solved for b correctly, but we made a mistake when we substituted 68 for o. We subtracted 68 from both sides of the equation instead of adding it. So let's fix that. \n\nWe know that \n\no + b = 12,\n\nand that \n\no = 68.\n\nSo \n\n68 + b = 12\n\n68 + b - 68 = 12 - 68\n\nb = -56 + 68\n\nb = 12\n\nThat seems more reasonable, because we know that \n\nb > 0.\n\n", "expected_answer": "24"}, {"id": "chal-82", "prompt": "Q: Brenda's mother made 14 cookies for 2 guests.
