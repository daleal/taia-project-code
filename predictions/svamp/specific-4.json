We know that the total amount spent on candy bars was $4, and that Dan bought 2 candy bars. So, we can write: \n\n$4 = 2c\n\nStep 2: \nSince we want to solve for c, that is, find out how much each candy bar cost, we want to move everything except for c to one side. In other words, we want to get c by itself on one side of the equation. To do this, we can divide both sides by 2. This gives us: \n\n$4/2 = 2c/2\n\nStep 3: \nNow that we have c by itself on one side of the equation, we can simplify. Dividing by 2 on both sides cancels out the 2 on the left side, giving us: \n\n$2 = c\n\nStep 4: \nWe have finally solved the equation!

Let's think about what we know and what we need to find out. We know that Paul got a box of 267 crayons, and we know that he lost 231 crayons. So we can say that\n\nPaul's original number of crayons = 267\nPaul's number of crayons lost = 231\n\nWe also know that he gave away 308 crayons to his friends. So we can say that\n\nPaul's number of crayons given away = 308\n\nWe want to find out how many more crayons he gave away to his friends than those he lost. So we can say that\n\nPaul's number of crayons given away - Paul's number of crayons lost = x\n\nWe can plug in what we know and solve for x.\n\n308 - 231 = x\nx = 77\n\nSo Paul gave away 77 more crayons to his friends than those he lost.", "expected_answer": "77"}, {"id": "chal-765", "prompt": "Q: If the cave is 919 feet deep and they need to travel 1307 feet How far is the end of the cave?\nA: Let's think step by step, using 4 steps.", "prediction": "\n\n1.

Adam has 9 apples. How many apples does Jackie have?\nA: Let's think step by step, using 4 steps.", "prediction": " \n\nStep 1: We are given that Adam has 3 more apples than Jackie. This means that if we start with the number of apples Jackie has, and then add 3, we will get the number of apples Adam has. In other words, if we let x equal the number of apples Jackie has, we can write this as:\n\nAdam has 3 more apples than Jackie.\nAdam has x + 3 apples.\n\nStep 2: We are told that Adam has 9 apples, so we can write this as:\n\nAdam has 9 apples.\nx + 3 = 9\n\nStep 3: We solve this equation to find out how many apples Jackie has.
