We're given some information in this step, which is that Matthew gave 2 crackers to each of his 11 friends. \n\nHow many crackers did Matthew have? \n\nThis is our question, and it is what we are trying to solve. \n\nLet's start with what we know. We know that Matthew gave 2 crackers to each of his 11 friends. So, if we multiply 2 times 11, we'll know how many crackers Matthew gave away. \n\n2 times 11 equals 22. So, Matthew gave away 22 crackers. \n\nNow, we just need to take 22 away from the total number of crackers Matthew had. We don't know how many crackers Matthew had, so we'll just use a variable to represent that number. \n\nIf we call the number of crackers Matthew had x, then we can say that x - 22 equals the number of crackers Matthew has left. \n\nWe want to know the value of x, which is the number of crackers Matthew had. So, we'll solve for x. \n\nTo solve for x, we'll need to add 22 to each side. \n\nOn the left side, we have x - 22. We'll add 22 to each side, which means we'll add 22 to both sides of the equation. \n\nOn the left side, we'll have x - 22 + 22. When we add 22 to x - 22, that cancels out to just x. So, on the left side of the equation, we'll just have x. \n\nOn the right side, we have 22 - 22. When we add 22 to 22 - 22, that cancels out to just 0. So, on the right side of the equation, we'll just have 0. \n\nWe started with the equation x - 22 = 0.

This can be written as 19 + Doug = Ed. \n\nStep 2: \nNext, we know that Ed lost some of his marbles at the playground. This means that the original amount of marbles that Ed had is now decreased. So, we will subtract to find out how many marbles Ed lost. We want to find out how many marbles Ed had originally, so we will subtract 8 (which is the number of marbles that Ed has now) from both sides.

If Ron is 15 feet tall and Dean is 6 feet shorter than Ron How deep was the water?\nA: Let's think step by step, using 3 steps.", "prediction": " \n\nThe first step is to find Dean's height. If we know that Ron is 15 feet tall, and we know that Dean is 6 feet shorter than Ron, then we can set up and solve the following equation: \n\n15 - 6 = 9 \n\nSo, Dean's height is 9 feet. \n\nThe second step is to find out how many times 9 feet is. In other words, we need to multiply 9 feet by 9. So: \n\n9 x 9 = 81 \n\nThe third, and final, step is to find out how deep the water is. In other words, we need to multiply 81 feet by 9. So: \n\n81 x 9 = 729 \n\nTherefore, the water is 729 feet deep.", "expected_answer": "81"}, {"id": "chal-992", "prompt": "Q: In a school there are 308 girls and 318 boys.
