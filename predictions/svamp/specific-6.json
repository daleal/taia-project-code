We know that the total number of points she scored was 21, so we can write:\n\n21 = 7g\n\nStep 2: Isolate the variable.\n\nTo isolate the variable, we want to move everything except for the variable to one side. In this case, that would mean we want to move everything except for g to the left side. Since everything except for g is on the right side, that means we want to move everything on the right side to the left side. We can do that by subtracting everything on the right side from both sides. So we get:\n\n21 - 21 = 7g - 21\n\n0 = 7g - 21\n\nStep 3: Subtract 7g from both sides.\n\nNow we want to move everything except for g to the left side, so we subtract 7g from both sides.

In this problem, we know that Jerry had 5 action figures, and we know that he added 9 more books. That means that he started with 2 books.

In this problem, we want to know how many more books than action figures were on his shelf. So we want to know if our answer makes sense in that context. We can do this by counting the number of action figures and the number of books on the shelf in our answer. \n\nAccording to our answer, Jerry would have -4 books on his shelf. This doesn't make sense, because you can't have a negative number of books.

We are given some information, and we are looking for some more information. In this case, we are given that Mary has added 3 cups of flour and 62 cups of sugar, and we are looking for how many more cups of flour she needs to add. Second, we need to think about what information we have and what information we are looking for. In this case, we have the information that Mary has already added 3 cups of flour, and we are looking for the number of cups of flour she still needs to add. This is the same as asking how many cups of flour are in 9 cups of flour minus the 3 cups of flour that Mary has already added. So, we have 9 cups of flour, and we want to find out how many are left after we subtract 3 cups of flour. Third, we need to think about what operation we will use to solve the problem. In this case, we will use subtraction, because we are subtracting 3 cups of flour from 9 cups of flour. Fourth, we need to solve the problem.
