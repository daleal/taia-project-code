If we start with 12 roses and 2 orchids and then subtract some number of flowers, the resulting number of flowers in the vase will be less than 12 roses and 2 orchids. So, if we know that the number of flowers in the vase after Jessica cut some is 10 roses and 21 orchids, then we can set up the equation:\n\n12 roses + 2 orchids - (some number of roses + some number of orchids) = 10 roses + 21 orchids\n\nIn other words, we can say that the total number of flowers Jessica cut from her garden must be equal to the difference between the original number of flowers in the vase and the current number of flowers in the vase.
