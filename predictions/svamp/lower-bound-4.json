We know that Ed originally had 19 more marbles than Doug. This can be represented by the equation: \n\nEd = 19 + Doug\n\nThe equation tells us that the value of Ed is 19 more than the value of Doug. \n\nNext, we know that Ed lost some of his marbles at the playground, so we need to take away some number of marbles from Ed. After he lost these marbles, he then had 8 more marbles than Doug. This can be represented by the equation: \n\nEd - x = 8 + Doug\n\nThe equation tells us that the value of Ed is 8 more than the value of Doug, and that x is the number of marbles Ed lost. \n\nNow that we have two equations, we can solve for x. To solve for x, we need to make the two equations equal to each other. That way, we can cancel out the values of Ed and Doug that appear on both sides, and what will be left is the value of x. \n\n Ed = 19 + Doug\nEd - x = 8 + Doug\n\nIf we add x to both sides of the first equation and subtract Doug from both sides of the second equation, we get: \n\nEd + x = 19 + 2Doug\nEd - x = 8\n\nNow if we add Doug to both sides of the first equation and subtract x from both sides of the second equation, we get: \n\n2Ed = 19 + 3Doug\nEd = 8\n\nIf we subtract 19 from both sides of the first equation and add 3Doug to both sides of the second equation, we get: \n\nEd = 0\nEd = 8\n\nThis is a contradiction, which means that our original set of information must have been flawed.", "expected_answer": "11"}, {"id": "chal-246", "prompt": "Q: They decided to hold the party in their backyard.

The question is saying that Jerry had 7 action figures and 2 books on a shelf. Then, he added 4 more books to his shelf. The question is asking how many more action figures than books were on his shelf. This is telling us that we need to compare the number of action figures to the number of books. \n\nSecond, let's think about what we know. We know that Jerry had 7 action figures and 2 books on a shelf. This means that he had a total of 9 items on his shelf. \n\nThird, let's think about what we need to find out. We need to find out how many more action figures than books were on his shelf. In other words, we need to find out how many more action figures Jerry had, than he had books. \n\nFourth, let's think about how to solve the problem. Since we need to compare the number of action figures to the number of books, let's make a comparison chart. \n\nAction Figures | Books\n7 | 2\n\nFrom the comparison chart, we can see that Jerry had 7 action figures and 2 books. This means that he had 5 more action figures than he had books.

In other words, for every 1 cup of flour, how many cups of sugar are needed? We can calculate this by dividing 9 cups of flour by 5 cups of sugar to get 1.8. So for every 1.8 cups of flour, 1 cup of sugar is needed. \nStep 2: How much flour does Mary have in proportion to sugar? We can calculate this by dividing 3 cups of flour by 62 cups of sugar to get 0.0488. So for every 0.0488 cups of flour, 1 cup of sugar is needed. \nStep 3: To find out how many more cups of flour Mary needs to add, we need to find how many cups of flour she needs so that the proportion of flour to sugar is the same as in the recipe. To do this, we need to divide 1 cup of sugar by the proportion of flour to sugar in the recipe. We know that the proportion of flour to sugar in the recipe is 1.8 cups of flour for every 1 cup of sugar. So we need to divide 1 cup of sugar by 1.8 to get 0.5556 cups of flour. \nStep 4: To find out how many cups of flour Mary has in total, we need to add the 3 cups of flour she has already used to the 0.5556 cups of flour she needs to add.

How many more green peaches than yellow peaches are in the basket?\nA: Let's think step by step, using at least 4 steps.", "prediction": " \n\nFirst, we can create a ratio comparing the number of yellow peaches to the number of green peaches. There are 6 yellow peaches and 14 green peaches, so the ratio is 6 to 14, or 6:14. \n\nFrom there, we can create a proportion. We know that in a proportions, equal ratios are equal to each other. So if we set up a proportion using our ratio of 6:14, it would look like this: \n\n6/14 = x/20 \n\nOn either side of the equal sign, we have our two ratios. The first ratio is 6 to 14, or 6:14. The second ratio is x to 20. In a proportion, the two ratios must be equal to each other, so whatever number we get for x must also be equal to the ratio of 6:14. \n\nWe can solve for x by using cross multiplication. Cross multiplication means that we will multiply 6 x 20 and 14 x 20, and set those two products equal to each other. When we do that, it looks like this: \n\n6(20) = 14(x) \n120 = 14x \n\nTo solve for x, we will divide 120 by 14 on both sides. When we do that, it looks like this: \n\n120/14 = 14x/14 \n120/14 = x \n\nThat means that x equals 120 divided by 14, which is 8.5. \n\nSo to answer the question, there are 8.5 more green peaches than yellow peaches in the basket.", "expected_answer": "8"}, {"id": "chal-446", "prompt": "Q: A book has 31 chapters.

If 82 snakes and 19 alligators were hiding How many alligators were not hiding?\nA: Let's think step by step, using at least 4 steps.", "prediction": " \n\nFirst, let's think about how we would solve a simpler problem. For example, let's say we had a cage with 10 snakes and 10 alligators, and we wanted to know how many alligators were not hiding. In this case, we would subtract the number of alligators hiding (let's say 5) from the total number of alligators in the cage (10). So 10 - 5 = 5. \n\nNow let's apply that to the problem at hand. We know that the cage has a total of 3 snakes and 75 alligators. We also know that 82 snakes and 19 alligators are hiding. So if we subtract the number of alligators hiding from the total number of alligators, we will be left with the number of alligators that are not hiding. \n\n3 snakes and 75 alligators \n- 82 snakes and 19 alligators (hiding)\n= \n\nTherefore, the number of alligators not hiding is 56.", "expected_answer": "56"}, {"id": "chal-998", "prompt": "Q: Paige was helping her mom plant flowers and together they planted 55 seeds.

This will help you to better understand the problem and make it easier to solve. \n\nIn this case, we need to figure out how many more cups of sugar Mary needs to add to the cake batter. We know that she has already added 4 cups of sugar and that the recipe calls for a total of 7 cups of sugar. \n\nSo, we need to solve for x in the equation: \n\n4 + x = 7 \n\nTo solve for x, we can subtract 4 from each side of the equation.
